# Context Management Fundamentals

**Why Context Matters**

> "The quality of AI output is directly proportional to the quality of context provided."

**Good Context =** 
- Relevant files and documentation
- Clear instructions and constraints
- Appropriate scope and boundaries

**Poor Context =**
- Irrelevant or outdated information
- Vague or conflicting guidance
- Too broad or too narrow scope

---

# Context Strategy Impact

| Context Quality | AI Output Quality | Developer Experience |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Excellent** | Highly relevant, accurate | Fast, confident |
| **Good** | Mostly useful, some editing | Productive |
| **Poor** | Off-target, needs rework | Frustrating |
| **Missing** | Random, unusable | Wasted time |

---

# Diagnosing Context Issues

**Common Symptoms**

- 🔴 AI suggestions are off-target
- 🔴 Repetitive or irrelevant responses
- 🔴 Missing key project conventions
- 🔴 Inconsistent code patterns

**Root Causes**

- Missing documentation
- Outdated context files
- Insufficient workspace configuration
- Unclear instructions

---

# Context Audit Framework

**What to Check**

1. ✅ Are all relevant files included?
2. ✅ Is documentation current and accessible?
3. ✅ Are instructions clear and specific?
4. ✅ Is scope appropriate for the task?
5. ✅ Are examples provided where helpful?
