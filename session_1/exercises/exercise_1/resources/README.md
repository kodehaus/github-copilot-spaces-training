# Exercise 1 Resources: Context Configuration Examples

This folder contains examples of **good** and **bad** workspace context configurations to help you understand what makes effective context for GitHub Copilot Spaces.

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the Good Examples** - See what complete, well-organized context looks like
2. **Review the Bad Examples** - Learn what to avoid and why it causes problems
3. **Compare Side-by-Side** - Notice the specific differences
4. **Apply to Your Work** - Use the good examples as templates for your own workspace setup

## Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | Good Example | Bad Example |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Clear sections, organized | Disorganized, scattered |
| **Completeness** | All necessary info included | Missing critical details |
| **Relevance** | Focused on current project | Includes irrelevant info |
| **Currency** | Up-to-date information | Outdated, deprecated content |
| **Clarity** | Specific, actionable | Vague, ambiguous |
| **Scope** | Appropriate depth | Too shallow or too detailed |

## What Makes Good Context?

✅ **Clear Project Overview**
- What the project does
- Key technologies used
- Architecture patterns

✅ **Specific Conventions**
- Code style guidelines
- Naming conventions
- File organization

✅ **Relevant Examples**
- Well-written code samples
- Common patterns used in the project
- Best practices demonstrated

✅ **Development Guidance**
- Setup instructions
- Testing approach
- Deployment process

## What Makes Bad Context?

❌ **Vague or Missing Information**
- "Use good practices" (too vague)
- Missing architecture documentation
- No code examples

❌ **Outdated Content**
- References to deprecated libraries
- Old version numbers
- Obsolete patterns

❌ **Information Overload**
- 50+ files with no organization
- Duplicate information
- Irrelevant historical context

❌ **Inconsistent or Conflicting**
- Multiple style guides that disagree
- Outdated docs contradicting current code
- Unclear which guidance to follow

## Exercise Application

As you work through Exercise 1, use these examples to:

1. **Part 1 (Create Workspace)** - Model your file selection after the good examples
2. **Part 2 (Configure Settings)** - Use good_examples/copilot-instructions.md as a template
3. **Part 3 (Validate Setup)** - Compare your workspace to these examples

**Remember:** Your goal is to create context that helps the AI help YOU effectively!
