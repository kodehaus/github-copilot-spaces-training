# Exercise 1: Practice Round 1

## Workspace Configuration

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Scaffolding:** High (Step-by-step guidance)

---

# Your Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- ✅ Apply Remember and Understand level skills
- ✅ Set up and configure a context-aware workspace
- ✅ Create a workspace with appropriate context sources
- ✅ Add and organize files, repositories, and instructions
- ✅ Validate that context is working as expected

---

# The Scenario

**You're joining a web application team**

Your task:
> Set up a GitHub Copilot Space that provides effective context for common development tasks like bug fixes, feature additions, and code reviews.

---

# Part 1: Create Your Workspace

**Time: 15 minutes**

---

# Step 1: Open GitHub Copilot Spaces

**Your Actions:**

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository (or create a practice repo)
2. Click "Open in GitHub Copilot Space"
3. Wait for the workspace to initialize

💡 **Tip:** If you don't have a repo, create a sample one first!

---

# Step 2: Add Essential Context Sources

**What to add:**

- ✅ Main README.md file
- ✅ Architecture documentation (if available)
- ✅ Coding standards or style guide
- ✅ At least one example of well-written code

💡 **Tip:** Start with documentation, then add code examples

---

# Step 3: Organize Your Context

**Make it clear and structured:**

- 📁 Group related files together
- 🏷️ Add clear labels or comments for each context source
- 🗑️ Remove unnecessary or redundant files

💡 **Tip:** Think about what someone NEW to the project would need

---

# Part 2: Configure Workspace Settings

**Time: 10 minutes**

---

# Step 4: Set Up Project Instructions

**Add custom instructions that explain:**

- Project type (web app, API, mobile app, etc.)
- Key technologies and frameworks used
- Important constraints or requirements

💡 **Example:** "This is a React web app using TypeScript and Express backend"

---

# Step 5: Add Development Context

**Include information about:**

- Development environment setup
- Testing requirements and frameworks
- Deployment or build process information

💡 **Tip:** The AI needs to know HOW your team works, not just WHAT you're building

---

# Part 3: Validate Your Setup

**Time: 15 minutes**

---

# Step 6: Test Context Quality

**Try these tests:**

1. Ask Copilot a question about project architecture
2. Request help with a common task:
   - "How do I add a new API endpoint?"
3. Evaluate if responses are specific and relevant

✅ **Good sign:** Copilot references YOUR project specifics
❌ **Bad sign:** Generic responses that could apply to any project

---

# Step 7: Quality Checklist

**Review your workspace:**

- [ ] All necessary project info included? (Coverage)
- [ ] No unnecessary/redundant info? (Relevance)
- [ ] Clear structure and labeling? (Organization)
- [ ] AI assistance quality improved? (Functionality)

**Make adjustments as needed**

---

# Step 8: Share and Document

**Your deliverables:**

1. 📸 Be prepared to visually share your workspace configuration
2. 📝 Write a brief summary of your approach (3-5 sentences)
3. ✅ Note any challenges you encountered
4. Be prepared to share what your team discovered

---

# Success Criteria

**You're successful if:**

- [ ] Created workspace with at least 5 relevant context sources
- [ ] Files, repositories, and instructions are logically organized
- [ ] Validated context is working (AI responses are specific)
- [ ] Workspace passes quality checklist (all 4 criteria)

---

# Need Help? 💡

**Hints Available:**

🔹 **Stuck on what to include?** Start with documentation files, then add representative code examples

🔹 **Not sure if context is working?** Ask specific questions about your project and see if responses reference your context

🔹 **Need examples?** Check the reference materials for sample workspace configurations

---

# Reflection Questions

**Take time to reflect:**

1. What was most challenging about this assessment?

2. How did your approach evolve from your first attempt?

3. What would you do differently next time?

4. How will you apply this skill in your real work?

---

# Let's Get Started!

**Remember:**
- Use the step-by-step guidance
- Ask for help if you get stuck
- Focus on learning, not perfection
