# Exercise 1: Practice Round 1 - Workspace Configuration

**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Assessment Type:** Hands-On Practice

**Scaffolding Level:** High (Step-by-step guidance provided)

## Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Apply Remember and Understand level skills
- Set up and configure a context-aware workspace for a real development scenario
- Create a workspace with appropriate context sources
- Add and organize files, repositories, and instructions
- Validate that context is working as expected

## Scenario

You're joining a team working on a web application project. Your task is to set up a GitHub Copilot Space that provides effective context for common development tasks like bug fixes, feature additions, and code reviews.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create Your Workspace (15 minutes)

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Spaces**
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository or create a practice repository
   - Click "Open in GitHub Copilot Space"
   - Wait for the workspace to initialize

2. **Add Essential Context Sources**
   - Add the main README.md file
   - Add architecture documentation (if available)
   - Add coding standards or style guide
   - Add at least one example of well-written code from the project

3. **Organize Your Context**
   - Group related files together
   - Add clear labels or comments explaining what each context source provides
   - Remove any unnecessary or redundant files

### Part 2: Configure Workspace Settings (10 minutes)

4. **Set Up Project Instructions**
   - Add a custom instruction explaining the project type
   - Include key technologies and frameworks used
   - Specify any important constraints or requirements

5. **Add Development Context**
   - Include information about the development environment
   - Add details about testing requirements
   - Include deployment or build process information

### Part 3: Validate Your Setup (15 minutes)

6. **Test Context Quality**
   - Ask Copilot a question about the project architecture
   - Request help with a common task (e.g., "How do I add a new API endpoint?")
   - Evaluate whether the responses are specific and relevant

7. **Quality Checklist**
   - Review your workspace against the criteria below
   - Make adjustments as needed
   - Document what works well and what needs improvement

8. **Share and Document**
   - Take a screenshot of your workspace configuration
   - Write a brief summary of your approach
   - Note any challenges you encountered

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Created a workspace with at least 5 relevant context sources
- [ ] Added and organized files, repositories, and instructions logically
- [ ] Validated that context is working (AI responses are specific and relevant)
- [ ] Workspace passes quality checklist:
  - [ ] Coverage: All necessary project information included
  - [ ] Relevance: No unnecessary or redundant information
  - [ ] Organization: Clear structure and labeling
  - [ ] Functionality: AI assistance quality is noticeably improved

## Hints & Support

💡 **Stuck on what to include?** Start with documentation files, then add representative code examples.

💡 **Not sure if context is working?** Ask specific questions about your project and see if responses reference your context.

💡 **Need examples?** Check the reference materials for sample workspace configurations.

## Deliverable

Submit:
1. Screenshot or description of your workspace configuration
2. Brief explanation (3-5 sentences) of your approach
3. Evidence that context is working (example AI response that uses your context)
