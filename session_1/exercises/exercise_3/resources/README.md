# Exercise 3 Resources: Workspace Audit Scenarios

This folder contains three real workspaces for you to audit. Each workspace has context issues that affect AI assistance quality.

## How to Use These Workspaces

1. **Examine each workspace folder** - Look at the files, structure, and content
2. **Apply the 5-Point Framework** - Evaluate each point systematically
3. **Identify specific issues** - Note concrete problems, not general observations
4. **Prioritize improvements** - Consider impact vs. effort
5. **Document your findings** - Use the deliverable template in exercise_3.md

## Folder Structure

```
exercise_3_resources/
├── README.md (this file)
├── workspace_a_overloaded/      # Too much context
├── workspace_b_minimal/         # Too little context
└── workspace_c_outdated/        # Stale context
```

## Evaluation Approach

For each workspace:

1. **Browse the files** - Spend 3-5 minutes exploring
2. **Note your observations** - What seems wrong or missing?
3. **Apply framework systematically** - Check each of the 5 points
4. **Test with a question** - Imagine asking the AI for help - what would go wrong?
5. **Prioritize fixes** - What would have the biggest impact?

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Some symptoms are red herrings** - Not every problem mentioned is a context issue. Focus on what affects AI assistance quality.

✅ **Be specific** - "Too many files" is vague. "50+ files including irrelevant test fixtures" is specific.

💡 **Think like a detective** - Look for evidence that explains the symptoms.

## Time Management

- 8 minutes per workspace (24 minutes total)
- 6 minutes for comparative analysis
- Total: 30 minutes

Remember: This is autonomous work. Minimal guidance is intentional - trust your analytical skills!
