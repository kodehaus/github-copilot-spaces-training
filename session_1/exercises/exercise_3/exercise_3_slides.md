# Exercise 3: Practice Round 3

## Advanced Diagnostics

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Scaffolding:** Low (Minimal guidance - work independently)

---

# Your Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- 🎓 Master diagnostic approaches for context issues
- 🎓 Compare different context engineering strategies
- 🎓 Work autonomously to solve context problems
- 🎓 Diagnose and identify improvement opportunities
- 🎓 Audit workspaces and prioritize improvements

---

# The Challenge

**You're the context expert now!**

You have access to 3 team workspaces.
Each has context issues causing poor AI assistance.

**Your mission:** Audit all three, diagnose problems, and recommend improvements.

---

# Your Diagnostic Tool

## 5-Point Context Audit Framework

Use this for EACH workspace:

1. ✅ **Workspace Files Complete?**
2. ✅ **Documentation Accessible?**
3. ✅ **Errors/Logs Visible?**
4. ✅ **Scope Appropriate?**
5. ✅ **Information Current?**

---

# Workspace A: The Overloaded Workspace

**Time: ~10 minutes**

---

# Workspace A - Symptoms

**What you observe:**

- 🐌 AI responses are slow
- 😕 Suggestions are generic and unfocused
- 📁 Context includes 50+ files

**The problem is obvious... but what's the ROOT CAUSE?**

---

# Workspace A - Your Task

**Autonomous work - minimal guidance:**

1. Audit using the 5-point framework
2. Identify at least 3 specific issues
3. Explain the impact of each issue on AI effectiveness
4. Prioritize improvements based on expected impact
5. Recommend specific actions aligned with best practices

---

# Workspace B: The Minimal Workspace

**Time: ~10 minutes**

---

# Workspace B - Symptoms

**What you observe:**

- ❓ AI asks many clarifying questions
- 🎯 Suggestions don't match project conventions
- 📄 Workspace includes only 2 files

**Too little context can be as bad as too much...**

---

# Workspace B - Your Task

**Autonomous work - minimal guidance:**

1. Audit using the 5-point framework
2. Identify at least 3 specific issues
3. Explain the impact of each issue on AI effectiveness
4. Prioritize improvements based on expected impact
5. Recommend specific actions aligned with best practices

---

# Workspace C: The Outdated Workspace

**Time: ~10 minutes**

---

# Workspace C - Symptoms

**What you observe:**

- ⚠️ AI suggests deprecated APIs
- 📅 Solutions use old patterns
- 📖 Documentation references version 1.0 (current is 3.5)

**The past is haunting this workspace...**

---

# Workspace C - Your Task

**Autonomous work - minimal guidance:**

1. Audit using the 5-point framework
2. Identify at least 3 specific issues
3. Explain the impact of each issue on AI effectiveness
4. Prioritize improvements based on expected impact
5. Recommend specific actions aligned with best practices

---

# 5-Point Framework Reminder

**Apply these questions to EACH workspace:**

1. **Files Complete?** Are all necessary files included? Anything missing?

2. **Documentation Accessible?** Can AI find and understand docs? Are they clear?

3. **Errors/Logs Visible?** Are debugging resources available?

4. **Scope Appropriate?** Too much or too little context? Focused?

5. **Information Current?** Is everything up-to-date? Any outdated examples?

---

# Success Criteria

**You're successful if:**

- [ ] Audited all 3 workspaces using 5-point framework
- [ ] Identified 3+ improvements per workspace (9+ total)
- [ ] Explained impact of issues on AI effectiveness
- [ ] Prioritized improvements (high/medium/low impact)
- [ ] Recommendations align with best practices
- [ ] Compared approaches across the three scenarios

---

# Working Autonomously

**This is your chance to demonstrate mastery:**

✅ Minimal hints provided (see next slide if desperate)
✅ Use reference materials as needed (self-directed)
✅ Apply everything you've learned today
✅ Trust your judgment

**You've got this!**

---

# Minimal Guidance Available

**Only if you're COMPLETELY stuck:**

💡 **Last resort:** Review the "Diagnosing Context Issues" concept from earlier in the session

💡 **Verification check:** Ask yourself: "Would this recommendation improve AI assistance quality?"

**Otherwise - work independently!**

---

# What to Submit

**For EACH workspace (A, B, C):**

1. **Audit Results**
   - 5-point framework checklist with findings
   - 3+ specific issues identified

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Explanation of how each issue affects AI effectiveness
   - Evidence or reasoning for your analysis

---

# What to Submit (continued)

3. **Prioritized Recommendations**
   - List improvements in priority order (high/medium/low)
   - Brief justification for each priority level
   - Specific actions to take

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - What patterns did you notice across the 3 workspaces?
   - Which workspace was most challenging to diagnose? Why?
   - What general principles can you extract?

---

# Reflection Questions

**Required reflections:**

1. What was most challenging about this assessment?
2. How did your approach evolve from your first attempt?
3. What would you do differently next time?
4. How did this at-bat feel different from the previous one?
5. What skills are becoming more automatic for you?
6. How will you apply this skill in your real work?

---

# Reflection Questions (continued)

**Additional reflections:**

7. Which of the three workspaces (A, B, or C) was most similar to a real situation you've encountered?

8. What diagnostic strategies worked best for you?

---

# Let's Get Started!

**Remember:**
- You have 30 minutes total (~10 min per workspace)
- Low scaffolding - work autonomously
- Apply the 5-point framework systematically
- Trust what you've learned today

**This is where you show your mastery!**

**Ready? Begin with Workspace A!**
