# Exercise 3: Practice Round 3 - Advanced Diagnostics

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Assessment Type:** Guided Practice (Autonomous Work)

**Scaffolding Level:** Low (Minimal guidance - work independently)

## Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Master diagnostic approaches for context issues
- Compare different context engineering strategies
- Work autonomously to solve context problems
- Diagnose context-related issues and identify improvement opportunities
- Audit a workspace and identify areas for improvement

## Challenge Scenario

You've been given access to three different team workspaces. Each has context issues causing poor AI assistance. Your task is to audit all three, diagnose the problems, and recommend improvements.

## Instructions

Work autonomously through the following challenges. Minimal guidance is provided - use the 5-Point Context Audit Framework and your judgment.

### Workspace A: The Overloaded Workspace

**Symptoms:**
- AI responses are slow
- Suggestions are generic and unfocused
- Context includes 50+ files

**Your Task:**
1. Audit the workspace using the 5-point framework
2. Identify at least 3 specific issues
3. Explain the impact of each issue on AI effectiveness
4. Prioritize improvements based on expected impact
5. Recommend specific actions aligned with best practices

### Workspace B: The Minimal Workspace

**Symptoms:**
- AI asks many clarifying questions
- Suggestions don't match project conventions
- Workspace includes only 2 files

**Your Task:**
1. Audit the workspace using the 5-point framework
2. Identify at least 3 specific issues
3. Explain the impact of each issue on AI effectiveness
4. Prioritize improvements based on expected impact
5. Recommend specific actions aligned with best practices

### Workspace C: The Outdated Workspace

**Symptoms:**
- AI suggests deprecated APIs
- Solutions use old patterns
- Documentation references version 1.0 (current is 3.5)

**Your Task:**
1. Audit the workspace using the 5-point framework
2. Identify at least 3 specific issues
3. Explain the impact of each issue on AI effectiveness
4. Prioritize improvements based on expected impact
5. Recommend specific actions aligned with best practices

## 5-Point Context Audit Framework

Use this framework to audit each workspace:

1. **Workspace Files Complete?**
   - Are all necessary files included?
   - Is anything important missing?

2. **Documentation Accessible?**
   - Can the AI find and understand project documentation?
   - Is documentation clear and current?

3. **Errors/Logs Visible?**
   - Are error messages and logs available when needed?
   - Is debugging information accessible?

4. **Scope Appropriate?**
   - Is there too much or too little context?
   - Is the context focused on relevant information?

5. **Information Current?**
   - Is all information up-to-date?
   - Are there outdated examples or documentation?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Audited all 3 workspaces using the 5-point framework
- [ ] Identified 3+ areas for improvement in each workspace (9+ total)
- [ ] Explained the impact of identified issues on AI effectiveness
- [ ] Prioritized improvements based on expected impact (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Recommendations align with documented best practices
- [ ] Compared approaches across the three different scenarios

## Work Autonomously

This is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery:
- Minimal hints provided below
- Use reference materials as needed (self-directed)
- Apply everything you've learned
- Trust your judgment

## Minimal Guidance Available

💡 **If you're completely stuck:** Review the "Diagnosing Context Issues" concept from earlier.

💡 **Need to verify your thinking?** Ask yourself: "Would this recommendation improve AI assistance quality?"

## Deliverable

For each workspace (A, B, C), submit:

1. **Audit Results**
   - 5-point framework checklist with findings
   - 3+ specific issues identified

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Explanation of how each issue affects AI effectiveness
   - Evidence or reasoning for your analysis

3. **Prioritized Recommendations**
   - List improvements in priority order (high/medium/low)
   - Brief justification for each priority level
   - Specific actions to take

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - What patterns did you notice across the three workspaces?
   - Which workspace was most challenging to diagnose? Why?
   - What general principles can you extract?
