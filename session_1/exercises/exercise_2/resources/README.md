# Exercise 2 Resources: Workflow Scenarios

This folder contains realistic scenarios for the three workflows in Exercise 2. Use these scenarios to practice analyzing context gaps and engineering effective solutions.

## How to Use These Scenarios

1. **Read each scenario carefully** - Understand the situation and what's being asked
2. **Analyze the context gap** - What information is missing that would help the AI?
3. **Reference Exercise 1 resources** - Use the good_examples from Exercise 1 as templates
4. **Engineer your solution** - Add appropriate context to your Copilot Space
5. **Test and iterate** - Verify the AI provides better assistance

## Important Notes

⚠️ **These are scenarios, not solutions**
- They describe the problem situation
- They don't tell you what context to add
- You must analyze and decide what context is needed

✅ **Use your Exercise 1 knowledge**
- Review the good_examples from Exercise 1
- Apply those patterns to these new scenarios
- Adapt the context to fit each workflow type

💡 **Think about the AI's perspective**
- What would YOU need to know to help with this problem?
- That's likely what the AI needs too

## Workflow-Specific Guidance

### Scenario 1: Debugging
**Key question:** What information helps identify the root cause?
- Error messages and stack traces
- State of the application when error occurred
- Related code that might be causing the issue

### Scenario 2: Feature Development
**Key question:** What ensures the new feature fits the existing system?
- Architectural patterns used in the project
- Examples of similar existing features
- Security and quality requirements

### Scenario 3: Code Review
**Key question:** What defines "good code" in this project?
- Style guides and conventions
- Project-specific patterns
- Common issues to watch for

## Success Tips

✅ **Start by analyzing** - Don't jump to adding context immediately
✅ **Be specific** - Generic context leads to generic AI responses
✅ **Test iteratively** - Add context, test, adjust, repeat
✅ **Document your reasoning** - Explain why you added what you added

Remember: The goal is to practice **analytical thinking** and **decision-making**, not just to complete the task!
