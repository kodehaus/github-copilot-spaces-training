## Pedagogical Approach

### Scaffolding Progression

The workshop uses **progressive release of responsibility**:

1. **High scaffolding** (Exercise 1) - Step-by-step guidance, clear examples
2. **Medium scaffolding** (Exercise 2) - Key decision points highlighted, hints available
3. **Low scaffolding** (Exercise 3) - Autonomous work, minimal guidance

### Active Learning Strategies

- **Guided discovery** - Participants analyze examples to derive principles
- **Compare and contrast** - Good vs. bad examples highlight effective patterns
- **Scenario-based learning** - Realistic workflows build transfer skills
- **Deliberate practice** - Multiple practice rounds with increasing complexity
- **Metacognition** - Reflection prompts after each exercise

### Assessment Design

Exercises follow **Bloom's Taxonomy** progression:
- Exercise 1: Remember, Understand (recognize patterns)
- Exercise 2: Apply, Analyze (use patterns in new contexts)
- Exercise 3: Evaluate, Create (audit and improve)

---

## Customization Options

### Time Adjustments

**2-hour version** (condensed):
- Skip Exercise 3 or make it homework
- Reduce concept presentation time to 12 minutes each
- Shorten practice rounds to 20 minutes each

**4-hour version** (extended):
- Add deeper dive into one concept area
- Include additional practice scenarios
- Add group discussions after each exercise
- Include live coding demonstrations

### Content Modifications

**For beginners:**
- Add GitHub Copilot basics introduction (15 min)
- Provide more scaffolding in Exercise 2-3
- Simplify scenario complexity

**For advanced users:**
- Reduce Exercise 1 time, focus on 2-3
- Add advanced topics (performance optimization, security context)
- Include enterprise-scale workspace management

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Participants don't have Copilot access"**
- Solution: Use free trial or demo accounts, or pivot to conceptual learning with examples

**"GitHub Copilot Spaces is down"**
- Solution: Use local workspace examples, focus on principles over tool-specific features

**"Running behind schedule"**
- Solution: Skip brain break, reduce reflection time, or make Exercise 3 homework

**"Participants finish exercises early"**
- Solution: Provide extension challenges in each exercise's "stretch goals" section

**"Mixed skill levels in room"**
- Solution: Pair experienced with novice learners, provide differentiated scenarios
