1. Identify and describe the core features and components of GitHub Copilot Spaces
2. Explain how context management works and why it matters for AI-assisted development
3. Set up and configure context-aware workspaces for real development scenarios
4. Use context engineering to accelerate common development workflows
5. Diagnose context-related issues and identify improvement opportunities
6. Assess the quality and effectiveness of context engineering approaches
7. Design and implement a comprehensive context engineering strategy for a real-world project

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub
- Experience with an IDE or code editor
- Familiarity with AI-assisted coding tools (helpful but not required)

## Course Schedule

### Session 1: Session 1
- **Duration:** 180 minutes
- **Time:** 0:00 - 3:00


## Key Concepts

### GitHub Copilot Spaces Core Features
**What it is:** An AI-powered development environment that integrates with GitHub to provide context-aware assistance.

**Key capabilities:**
- GitHub issues integration
- Pull request context awareness
- Work item tracking
- Feature scaffolding

### Context Management Fundamentals
**Why it matters:** The quality of context you provide directly determines the quality of AI assistance you receive.

**Good Context includes:**
- Clear problem statement
- Relevant code files
- Project documentation
- Current state and goal

**Poor Context leads to:**
- Generic suggestions
- Irrelevant solutions
- Wasted time iterating

### Diagnosing Context Issues
**Common symptoms:**
- AI gives generic responses
- Suggestions don't fit your stack
- Repeated clarification questions
- Solutions ignore constraints

**How to diagnose:**
1. Check workspace completeness
2. Verify documentation accessibility
3. Review error visibility
4. Assess scope appropriateness
5. Evaluate information recency
